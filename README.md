React Skeleton

This is a React Skeleton React, Reflux, Bootstrap and SASS skeleton.

To use it, you need to run
  npm install
to install the modules

In order to work with this skeleton, use the commands:

npm run start : will watch .jsx files changes and build the main.js file (which will contain the application)

npm run server : will launch an express server that can be used to test your files. Note that if you just want a server to test your application without any data interaction, go to the /public folder and use http-server.
